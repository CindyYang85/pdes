"utils" is a set of utilities developed over several years to ease C++
coding efforts.  Currently, it consists of:

- simple string utilties
- argument parser
- configuration file infrastructure

These utilities have been developed over several years (since the late
80's) and while other, more standard options may now exist, until the
warped code is ported away from these utilities, they must be maintained.
